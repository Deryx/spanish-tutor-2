# My Spanish Tutor

**My Spanish Tutor** is an application created to help beginning learners, including myself, learn Spanish by studying flashcards and utilizing various other exercises - a verb conjugator, verb and vocabulary sliders, vocabulary completion, fill-in, quiz, and scramble. Another primary motivation for creating this application was to:

* Learn Angular 2+
* Implement the following data storage solutions:
	* JSON
	* MongoDB
	* Serverless AWS
	* SQLite3
* Learn GraphQL
