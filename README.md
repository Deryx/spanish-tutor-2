# My Spanish Tutor

**My Spanish Tutor** is an application created to help beginning learners, including myself, learn Spanish by studying flashcards and utilizing various other exercises. Another primary motivation for creating this application was to:

* Learn Angular 2+
* Implement the following data storage solutions:
	* JSON
	* MongoDB
	* Serverless AWS
	* DynamoDB
	* SQLite3
* Learn GraphQL


## Features

My Spanish Tutor features the following mini-applications:

#### Verbs
* Conjugation Flashcards
* Conjugator
* Slider

#### Vocabulary
* Flashcards
* Completion
* Fill-in
* Quiz
* Scramble
* Slider

At the present time, the verbs in the **indicative** mood. The other two moods, **subjunctive** and **imperative** will come later.

 ## Working Site
 
 The working site is hosted by GitHub and based on the sqlite branch without using the sqlite database. The branch actually uses several json files - verbs, conjugations, tenses, vocabulary, and categories - that were created from sqlite3 database found in the branch sqlite. You can access the site with the link below:
